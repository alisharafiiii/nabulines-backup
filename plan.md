# NABULINES Project Plan & Architecture

## Overview
NABULINES is a web application built using Coinbase's MiniKit framework, which provides a set of tools and components for creating mini-applications on Base. The application leverages MiniKit's features for wallet integration, identity management, and frame handling.

## Core Technologies
- Next.js (React framework)
- MiniKit (@coinbase/onchainkit)
- Base blockchain integration

## Architecture Components

### 1. Application Structure
```
app/
├── page.tsx (Main application entry point)
├── components/
│   ├── DemoComponents.tsx (Custom UI components)
│   ├── Home.tsx (Home page component)
│   └── Features.tsx (Features page component)
```

### 2. Key Features & Components

#### A. MiniKit Integration
- **Wallet Management**
  - ConnectWallet component for wallet connection
  - WalletDropdown for wallet actions
  - Identity display (Avatar, Name, Address, EthBalance)

- **Frame Handling**
  - useMiniKit hook for frame management
  - Frame saving functionality
  - Frame state management

#### B. UI Components
- Custom Button component
- Icon system
- Tab-based navigation (Home/Features)
- Responsive layout with max-width constraints

### 3. Data Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Application loads and initializes MiniKit
   - Frame ready state is set
   - Wallet connection is prepared

2. **User Interaction Flow**
   - User connects wallet
   - Identity information is displayed
   - User can save frame
   - Navigation between Home and Features tabs

3. **State Management**
   - Local state for frame addition
   - Active tab state
   - MiniKit context management

### 4. Integration Points

#### A. Base Blockchain
- Wallet connection
- Identity verification
- Transaction capabilities

#### B. MiniKit Services
- Frame management
- Wallet integration
- Identity components

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. State Management
```typescript
// Key state variables
const [frameAdded, setFrameAdded] = useState(false);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("home");
const { setFrameReady, isFrameReady, context } = useMiniKit();
```

### 2. Core Functionality
- Frame saving mechanism
- Wallet connection handling
- Tab navigation system
- Responsive UI components

### 3. Security Considerations
- Secure wallet integration
- Frame validation
- Identity verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Feature Expansion**
   - Additional tabs/pages
   - Enhanced wallet functionality
   - More frame interactions

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Advanced animations
   - Custom theme support
   - Enhanced responsive design

3. **Integration Possibilities**
   - Additional blockchain features
   - Smart contract integration
   - Enhanced identity management

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow React best practices
   - Maintain component separation
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

2. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks effectively
   - Maintain clean state transitions
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Component testing
   - State management testing
   - Integration testing with MiniKit

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Base network configuration
   - MiniKit initialization
   - Wallet provider setup

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Asset optimization

3. **Monitoring**
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - User analytics

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building and extending the NABULINES application while maintaining clean separation of concerns and following best practices for React and MiniKit development.
